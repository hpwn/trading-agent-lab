# Trading Agent Lab (CLI-only)

- v0: RSI mean reversion baseline with daily bars on a single symbol.
- Day/Night loop: paper/backtest behavior during market, self-tune after hours.
- Next: metrics persistence, Optuna tuner, multi-agent league & capital allocation.

## Quickstart
```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
cp .env.example .env
tal backtest --config config/base.yaml
tal orchestrate --config config/base.yaml
```

## Dev setup

- Install tooling: `pip install -e ".[dev]"`
- Type check: `mypy src`
- Lint: `ruff check .`

## Running multiple agents

The CLI exposes agent-aware commands that load an `AgentSpec` and run the
existing backtest/orchestrator tooling with the derived engine config.

```bash
tal agent backtest --config config/agents/codex_seed.yaml
tal agent run --config config/agents/codex_seed.yaml
```

To run multiple agents simultaneously with Docker Compose, uncomment and
adapt the example services in `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
  # agent_codex_seed:
  #   build: .
  #   env_file: .env
  #   command: ["agent","run","--config","config/agents/codex_seed.yaml"]
  #   volumes: ["./artifacts:/app/artifacts", "./lab.db:/app/lab.db"]

  # agent_rsi_v2:
  #   image: trading-agent-lab-lab
  #   command: ["agent","run","--config","config/agents/rsi_v2.yaml"]
  #   volumes: ["./artifacts:/app/artifacts", "./lab.db:/app/lab.db"]
```

For a one-off backtest inside Docker without editing the compose file:

```bash
docker compose run --rm lab tal agent backtest --config config/agents/codex_seed.yaml
```

## Live (paper)

The new live wrapper provides a deterministic ‚Äúpaper‚Äù execution path that reuses
the engine configuration. It defaults to the in-repo simulator so tests remain
offline and reproducible.

- `tal live --config config/agents/codex_seed.yaml`
- `tal agent live --config config/agents/codex_seed.yaml`

The broker is selected via the `live` block in your engine or agent config
(`sim` for the offline simulator, `alpaca` for Alpaca's paper trading API).
Real broker connectivity remains behind an optional extra:

```bash
pip install -e ".[alpaca]"
```

Tests and CI only exercise the simulator‚Äîno network calls are made.

### Real-mode safety lock

Even if you set `LIVE_BROKER=alpaca_real`, the lab refuses to send real orders
unless you also set `REAL_TRADING_ENABLED=true`. This environment flag must be
deliberately enabled before any real broker session can start.

Use `tal doctor alpaca` to confirm your setup:

- `live_broker: alpaca_real`
- `real_trading_enabled: True`

Leave `REAL_TRADING_ENABLED` unset during day-to-day development to keep the
paper/simulator paths safe by default.

### Paper after-hours (opt-in)

Paper sessions now support an explicit after-hours toggle. Set
`allow_after_hours: true` under the `live:` block of your config (for example
`config/live/alpaca_paper.yaml`) to opt into extended-hours routing when the
market is closed. Orders remain paper-only by default and still respect the
`REAL_TRADING_ENABLED` gate when pointing at real brokers.

```yaml
live:
  adapter: "alpaca"
  paper: true
  allow_after_hours: true
```

When enabled the Alpaca paper client receives `extended_hours=true`, allowing
tiny smoke trades even when the exchange is closed. Alpaca requires these
extended-hours orders to be **DAY + LIMIT**, so the broker sets a protective
limit around the quoted price while continuing to use MARKET orders during
regular hours.

You can also flip after-hours per run with `ALLOW_AFTER_HOURS=1 tal live --config
config/live/alpaca_paper.yaml`; the CLI honors this environment variable even if
your YAML omits `allow_after_hours:`.

`tal doctor alpaca` surfaces the effective flag so you can confirm your runtime
environment before sending orders.

### Live loop & flatten helpers

Need to exercise a strategy over multiple live steps? Enable the loop runner and
optionally flatten any leftover position at the end:

```bash
tal live --config config/live/alpaca_paper.yaml --loop --interval 2 --max-steps 30 --flat-at-end
```

To force-close the configured symbol on demand (paper, sim, or real‚Äîsubject to
the usual safety gates), use the dedicated flatten command:

```bash
tal live close --config config/live/alpaca_paper.yaml
```

Both paths record fills to the live ledger and database, making it easy to
inspect round-trips with `tal ledger tail` or `tal orders tail`. The flatten
path also reports realized PnL for the simulator, unlocking live profit badges
when enabled.

## Configuration

### .env autoload

The `tal` CLI auto-loads a local `.env` from your current working directory.

- **Precedence:** real environment variables > `.env` entries.
- Already-exported variables in your shell are **not** overridden by `.env`.

Required for Alpaca paper/live setups:

```
ALPACA_API_KEY_ID=...
ALPACA_API_SECRET_KEY=...
ALPACA_PAPER=true

# Optional overrides
ALPACA_BASE_URL=https://paper-api.alpaca.markets
ALPACA_DATA_URL=https://data.alpaca.markets
```

- Trading and data use different hosts. Don't pass a trading URL to the data
  client; the SDK defaults to `https://data.alpaca.markets`.
- `ALPACA_BASE_URL` (optional) overrides the *trading* endpoint.

### Alpaca (paper) quickstart

Install the optional runtime extra before running any paper trades:

```bash
pip install -e ".[alpaca]"
```

Point the live CLI to the bundled paper config to try the integration:

```bash
tal live --config config/live/alpaca_paper.yaml
```

The config enables guardrails‚Äîmax order notional, position sizing caps, and
daily loss protection‚Äîall enforced locally before the request is sent to Alpaca.

## Achievements (optional & fun)

Unlock playful milestones as you trade‚Äîpurely cosmetic but great for morale.

- First $1/$10/$100/$1000 trade notional (tracked separately for paper vs. live).
- First $1/$10/$100/$1000 profit milestones converted from PnL.
- Artifacts live under `artifacts/achievements/` (state, NDJSON log, badge files).
- CLI helpers: `tal achievements ls` and `tal achievements reset --yes`.
- Progress snapshot: `tal achievements status` lists unlocked keys and upcoming
  thresholds by track.
- Generate README flair with `tal achievements badges --readme README.md` (manual; not run in CI).
- Colors: green badges are unlocked, grey badges are waiting on future wins.
- Profit source is configurable via `ACHIEVEMENTS_PROFIT_SOURCE={eval|live|both}`
  (default `eval`). Select `live` or `both` to unlock profit badges from
  realized simulator/paper PnL (e.g., after a loop flatten).
- Pass `--emojis` to `tal achievements badges` to append `üîì`/`üîí` markers to labels
  without changing the legacy defaults.

<!-- ACHIEVEMENTS:START -->
<!-- ACHIEVEMENTS:END -->

Badges are stored as JSON for easy piping into dashboards or overlays down the road.

### Live signal routing & sizing

- Signals are produced by the configured strategy (defaults to `rsi_mean_rev`) using
  the most recent `live.bars` closes for the first universe symbol.
- Current routing maps signals to targets as: `+1` ‚Üí long position sized by
  `strategy.params.size_pct`, `0/-1` ‚Üí flat (no shorts yet). The live position is
  additionally capped by `live.max_position_pct` of current equity.
- Simulated fills are routed through the in-memory broker to reach the target.
- Tests can provide deterministic price history by passing a price map directly to
  `tal.live.wrapper.run_live_once` (see `tests/test_live_signal_routing.py`).

## League manager

Coordinate multiple agents with the new league controller. By default the league
operates entirely offline‚Äî`tal live` and the league runner both use the
simulated broker, so CI and local development remain deterministic.

```bash
tal league live-once --config config/base.yaml
tal league nightly --config config/base.yaml
```

`league live-once` runs a single live step for every agent YAML under
`league.agents_dir`, redirecting each agent to its own ledger directory under
`league.artifacts_dir`. The nightly command loads recent performance from the
shared SQLite database, aggregates metrics, and writes promotion/retirement
recommendations to `artifacts/league/allocations.json`.

Inspect recent activity without cracking open the database manually:

```bash
tal orders tail --limit 10
tal ledger tail --limit 5
```

Each agent specification now captures provenance metadata (`builder` and
`lineage` blocks). This information is persisted in the `agents` table whenever
live or backtest runs are recorded. The leaderboard CLI supports grouping by
agent or builder to compare strategies from the same model family:

```bash
tal eval --group builder --since 30d --format table
```

The builder view collapses agents by `builder_name`, averaging KPIs across the
latest runs. Use this to compare parameter mutations from the same base model or
prompt lineage.
## Docker Quickstart

```bash
docker compose build --no-cache
docker compose up
# Logs stream immediately (unbuffered). Ctrl+C to stop.
docker compose down
```

**Troubleshooting**

* No logs? Ensure your image includes `ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1` (see Dockerfile).
* Force a single backtest in a one-off container:

```bash
docker compose run --rm lab tal backtest --config config/base.yaml
```

* To force ‚Äúmarket open‚Äù path quickly, copy config then widen hours:

```bash
cp config/base.yaml config/dev.yaml
# set orchestrator.cycle_minutes: 1
# set open: "00:01"  and close: "23:59"
docker compose run --rm lab tal orchestrate --config config/dev.yaml
```

## Tests & CI

Local:
```bash
python -m pip install -U pip
pip install -e .[test]
pytest
```

CI runs on PRs (Python 3.11/3.12) and also builds the Docker image. Lint/type checks use Ruff & mypy:

```bash
pip install -e .[lint]
ruff check .
mypy --ignore-missing-imports src
```
